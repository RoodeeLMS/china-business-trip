Key Test Categories You May Witness:
Your role is typically designated as a Witness, focusing on verifying that the prototype functions meet contract requirements. The required prototype functional tests (ST-1000 through ST-1510 for HHPSD and ST-5000 through ST-5510 for FHPSD) have specified requirements you must observe.
Test Category (Example Requirements)
Duration
Physical/Dimensional Checks (ST-1000 / ST-5000): Verify dimensions and confirm coating thickness is a minimum of 60μm. Also, check for no abrupt irregularities or sharp edges.
60 minutes per door type
Electrical Checks (ST-1010 / ST-5010): Ensure Insulation Test results are > 5 kΩ (at 500 VDC) and Continuity Test results are < 1 Ω.
20 minutes per door type
Functional Tests (Door Motion Profile): Confirm that the closing force is less than 140 N and the speed does not exceed 0.5 m/s during opening/closing. Opening time must be < 3.0 seconds and closing time < 3.5 seconds.
60 minutes per door type
Obstacle Detection (ST-1140 / ST-5140): Verify detection works with a minimum 10 mm gap. The door must reopen by 500 mm ± 20 mm (adjustable down to 30 cm) and attempt to close up to the nominal 3 consecutive times before ceasing movement.
15 minutes per door type
Maintenance Demonstration (ST-3000 / ST-7000): Critical components (like DCU, Motor, PLC) must be physically replaced with a Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) of less than 30 minutes for each component.
Estimated Duration: 240–300 minutes total
