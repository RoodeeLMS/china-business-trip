This executive summary provides an overview of the Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) activities, objectives, key technical requirements, and logistical details associated with the Platform Screen Door (PSD) Prototype validation for the MRT Orange Line Project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Executive Summary: Platform Screen Door (PSD) Prototype Validation
This summary relates to the verification of the Platform Screen Door (PSD) Functional Prototype and Accelerated Life Cycle Test Procedure (Submission PSD-40002.B). The objective of the prototype test is to ensure that the functions implemented are as per required by the design and contract.
1. Scope and Locations
The overall PSD validation encompasses two main components: the Half Height Platform Screen Door (HHPSD) prototype and the Full Height Platform Screen Door (FHPSD) prototype.
Activity Type
Location (Confirmed)
Dates (Confirmed)
Doorway Module FAT & TOT (Itinerary Focus)
Zhejiang Rongchen Technology Co., Ltd. in Haiyan County, Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, China
November 10 – 14, 2025
Functional Prototype & Life Cycle Test Plan
ST Engineering Urban Solutions Ltd., Singapore
Test completion records are generated in Singapore for functional (ST-1XXX/ST-5XXX) and life cycle (ST-2000/ST-6000) activities.
The itinerary in China (November 10–14, 2025) specifically includes a Transfer of Technology (TOT)/Workshop and the FHPSD Doorway Module Test - FT 7100 and HHPSD Doorway Module - FT3000.
2. Critical Performance Requirements (Witnessing Focus)
As a designated Witness, the focus areas during the functional tests (ST-1000 through ST-1510 for HHPSD and ST-5000 through ST-5510 for FHPSD) include verification against strict functional and safety criteria:
A. Door Motion and Safety
• Closing Force: Must be less than 140 N at any door leaf.
• Speed: Should not exceed 0.5 m/s during door opening/closing.
• Timing: Time from unlatching to fully opened must be less than 3.0 seconds. Time from closing to fully closed and locked must be less than 3.5 seconds.
• Emergency Release: Emergency Release Mechanism (ERM) unlocking force and Panic Bar unlocking force must be less than or equal to 67 N. The subsequent force required to push the door open must be less than 133 N.
B. Obstacle Detection
• The system must be able to detect obstacles with a minimum gap of 10 mm.
• Upon detection, the door must reopen by a nominal 500 mm ± 20 mm (reopen distance is adjustable, minimum 30 cm).
• The door will attempt to close a nominal three consecutive times before ceasing movement.
C. Electrical and Physical Integrity
• Insulation Test: Requirement is > 5 kΩ per platform when tested under 500 VDC.
• Continuity Test: Requirement is < 1 Ω.
• Coating Thickness: Must be measured and verified at a minimum thickness of 60 μm on components like frames and sub-frames.
• Visual Check: Verify no abrupt irregularities or sharp edges are present.
3. Accelerated Life Cycle and Maintenance
The prototype testing includes long-term reliability and maintainability verification:
• Life Cycle Endurance (ST-2000/ST-6000): The system must demonstrate the capability to complete 1 million cycles of continuous open and close operation, estimated to take about 4.6 months.
    ◦ Key Criterion: During the 1 million cycle test, there should not be any fatal alarm record in the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) or error log.
    ◦ Wear Limits: Wear on critical mechanism components (like the motor tooth belt, locking latch, or guide rail/gliders) must be not more than 1mm from the original size.
• Maintenance Demonstration (ST-3000/ST-7000): The replacement of critical components (e.g., DCU, Motor, PLC, ASD Glass) must be physically demonstrated with a Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) of less than 30 minutes for each component.
4. Key Documentation and Personnel
Witnesses (BEM, CK, MRTA, PCOR) must ensure they sign the Attendance Sheet (Annex F) upon arrival and review and sign-off on the Punch List (Annex E), which will be submitted with the final test report. Key attendees for the China trip include representatives from BEM, PCOR, MRTA, CK, and STE/STE(TH).
