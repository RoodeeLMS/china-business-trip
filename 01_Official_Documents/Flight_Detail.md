Distinction from Singapore Testing
It is important to note that various PSD functional prototype and accelerated life cycle tests (including tests ST-1000 through ST-7000) are detailed in related documentation, with a confirmed Test Location in Singapore at ST Engineering Urban Solutions Ltd.. Your trip, however, is confirmed for the Doorway Module FAT specifically in China.
For the tests conducted in Singapore, key organizations like BEM, CK, and MRTA are generally designated as Witnesses. These functional tests are comprehensive, covering HHPSD (Half Height) and FHPSD (Full Height) performance, electrical checks, acoustic tests, and Accelerated Life Cycle Inspections (ST-2000/ST-6000), which aim to confirm the system can complete 1 million cycles of continuous open and close operation.
