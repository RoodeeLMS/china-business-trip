Based on the sources detailing the Functional Prototype and Accelerated Life Cycle Test Procedure for the Platform Screen Doors (PSD) of the MRT Orange Line Project, here is a summary action plan to guide your travel and witnessing duties for the Factory Acceptance Test (FAT).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action Plan Summary for Witnessing the PSD Prototype FAT
Phase 1: Travel and Logistics Preparation
1. Confirm Test Location: The required tests will be conducted in Singapore at the location specified: ST Engineering Urban Solutions Ltd. 24 Ang Mo Kio Street 65 Block D Level 1 High Bay Area, Singapore 569061.
2. Acknowledge Your Role: Your role, likely representing MRTA, BEM, or CK, is generally designated as a Witness for the prototype functional test. The presence of witnesses (BEM, CK, MRTA) is explicitly tracked in the test commencement and completion records.
3. Review Necessary Documents: The overall test submission (PSD-40002.B) covers the functional prototype and accelerated life cycle testing. Key annexes for records you will interact with are:
    ◦ Annex F – Attendance Sheet: Ensure you sign this sheet upon arrival.
    ◦ Annex E – Punch List: Review and sign-off on the punch list, which will be attached in each test report submission.
    ◦ HHPSD/FHPSD Function Test Records (Annex A/C): These annexes detail the steps and criteria for the functional tests you will observe.
4. Remote Monitoring/Inspection Check: Be aware that the continuous Accelerated Life Cycle Testing is monitored using surveillance CCTV for remote monitoring (in Singapore), so key stakeholders (BEM, CK, MRTA, PCOR) may be invited for online inspections at the cycle milestones (250,000, 500,000, 750,000, and 1,000,000 cycles). Confirm which specific inspection milestones require your onsite presence versus remote/online viewing.
Phase 2: Onsite Witnessing Focus Areas
The prototype test covers two primary door types: Half Height Platform Screen Door (HHPSD) and Full Height Platform Screen Door (FHPSD). You will be witnessing several sequential test categories for both types.
Test Category
Key Test Objectives/Actions (Witness Focus)
Relevant Annex/Test IDs
Estimated Duration (Each Door Type)
Physical Checks
Verify no visible defects (dents, scratches). Check component fittings and cable termination. Verify dimensions (e.g., PSC cabinet, door frames, gap fillers) and ensure coating thickness measurement is performed (Min. 60μm). Also, verify that no abrupt irregularities or sharp edges are present.
A-3 (ST-1000) / C-3 (ST-5000)
60 minutes
Electrical Checks
Witness the Insulation Test (Requirement: > 5 kΩ per platform @ 500 VDC) and the Continuity Test (Requirement: < 1 Ω). Ensure safety precautions (like ensuring power is off and no contact during testing) are followed.
A-4 (ST-1010) / C-4 (ST-5010)
20 minutes
Functional Tests
Door Operation Mode Test: Observe manual operations using the Local Control Panel (LCP) and Driver Local Control Panel (DLCP), ensuring correct status indicators (PSI illumination, DOI blinking/steady) during Open, Close, and Interlock Override modes. Also, confirm the operation of the LCKS Isolation mode (DOS steady red light, door mechanically locked, key removable). EED/ERM Test: Verify emergency unlocking force (≤ 67 N) and subsequent door opening force (≤ 133 N). Door Motion Profile: Confirm closing force is less than 140N, door speeds do not exceed 0.5 m/s, and opening/closing times are met (Open: < 3.0 s; Close: < 3.5 s). Observe the waveform capture via oscilloscope. Obstacle Detection: Verify detection works with a minimum gap of 10mm. Confirm the door reopens (nominal 500mm ± 20mm, adjustable down to 30cm) and attempts to close up to the nominal 3 consecutive times before ceasing movement.
A-6 (ST-1120), A-7 (ST-1130), A-8 (ST-1140), A-11 (ST-1410), A-12 (ST-1510) / C-6 (ST-5120), C-7 (ST-5130), C-8 (ST-5140), C-11 (ST-5410), C-12 (ST-5510)
Varies (e.g., 60 mins for Motion Profile, 15 mins for Obstacle Detection)
Acoustic Test
Measure background noise (should be below 58 dBA) and the operating noise level (average noise level must be below 73 dBA during opening and closing).
A-10 (ST-1310) / C-10 (ST-5310)
10 minutes
Portable Test Unit (PTU)
Witness the connection and successful login to the PTU software, verifying the display of doorway information (e.g., software version, motor status). Observe the critical function demonstration, including changing the obstacle number of re-tries and re-opening distance parameters.
A-9 (ST-1210) / C-9 (ST-5210)
15 minutes
Phase 3: Accelerated Life Cycle and Maintenance
1. Accelerated Life Cycle Inspection (ST-2000/ST-6000): This inspection confirms the system can complete 1 million cycles of continuous open and close operation. This continuous testing is estimated to take about 4.6 months. Inspections are conducted at the start, 250,000, 500,000, 750,000, and 1,000,000 cycles.
    ◦ Focus: Review checkpoints related to wear and tear on major components, including the motor tooth belt, top guide rail (HHPSD) or bottom nylon guide (FHPSD), locking latch, and locking pin. Wear should be not more than 1mm from the original size.
    ◦ Event Log: Check the event log (Annex B-7 / D-7) to register any stoppages or unforeseen events during the 1 million cycle test. A critical criterion is that during the 1 million cycle test, there should not be any fatal alarm record in the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) or error log.
2. Maintenance Demonstration (ST-3000/ST-7000): Witness the physical replacement of critical components to demonstrate maintenance capability.
    ◦ Focus: Ensure replacement tasks (e.g., DCU, Belt, Motor, ASD Glass, PLC) are completed within the required Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) of < 30 minutes for each component.
3. Completion Sign-off: Ensure all testing completion records for the individual test IDs (ST-1000 through ST-1510, ST-2000, ST-3000, and the corresponding FHPSD tests) are completed and signed by the Lead Test Engineer and the required witnesses (BEM, CK, MRTA).
