## ❓ Quick FAQs

**Q: Do I really need WeChat Pay? Can't I just use credit card?**  
A: NO. Credit cards have very limited acceptance in China. WeChat Pay is essential. 90% of places prefer mobile payment.

**Q: Is it safe to link my credit card to WeChat?**  
A: Yes, it's very safe. Use credit card (not debit) for better fraud protection. Millions use it daily.

**Q: What if my WeChat Pay doesn't work?**  
A: Use cash. That's why you have ¥2,500-3,000 as backup. Always works.

**Q: Can I set this up when I arrive in China?**  
A: Very difficult! Do it NOW in Thailand where you have:
- Easy access to Thai phone number
- Good internet
- English app interface
- Time to verify with bank

**Q: How much total money do I need?**  
A: ฿5,000-6,000 liquid funds (WeChat + Cash). Company covers most expenses.

**Q: What if I lose my phone?**  
A: Use your backup cash. Contact hotel staff. Call credit card company. You'll have ¥1,500+ in hotel safe.

**Q: Should I exchange all money before leaving?**  
A: Exchange ฿3,000 before leaving. Can withdraw more from ATM in China if really needed (but fees are high ~¥15-30).
