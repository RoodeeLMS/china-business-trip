Works on all devices - desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### Offline-Capable
Once loaded, the dashboard works without internet. Maps work via Amap URI links (opens Amap app).

---

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Amap Integration ⭐ UPDATED!
Maps now use Amap (高德地图) instead of Google Maps for China:
1. All map links work via Amap URI scheme
2. No API key required for basic map links
3. Direct "Open in Amap" and "Navigate" buttons
4. Interactive map version available in `05_Maps/` (requires Amap API key)

**Why Amap?** Google Maps is blocked in China. Amap works perfectly without VPN!

### Browser Recommendations
- ✅ Best: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- ✅ Good: Edge
- ❌ Not supported: Internet Explorer
